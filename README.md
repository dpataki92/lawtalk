# README

Lawtalk is legal Q&A site that intends to function as a “legal stack overflow”. Users can discuss legal issues, ask questions, provide answers, upvote or downvote answers, and search for Q&A threads relevant to their jurisdiction and chosen legal areas in various ways. 

The app uses React and Redux on the front-end and Rails on the back-end as an API. The project was built as part of my studies at the Flatiron School (US).
