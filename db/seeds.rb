If you move to another EU country for more than 6 months, you must under EU rules register your car in the new country.For registration taxes, however, there are no EU-wide rules. Countries may levy car-registration taxes or not, as they choose. Some –including Cyprus–do NOT tax you if you had to pay a similar tax when you bought the car new.", user: u12)
q1.answers.create(content: "If a country does tax imported second-hand cars, it must take account of the residual value when setting the amount of registration tax. Example: your type of car has a value in the new country of€10,000 when new and the tax on such a car would be €2,500 so that the car would cost €12,500 intotal and the tax component of the price would be 20%. Assume that you move the car when it is 5 years old and that after 5 years a similar car in the new country would be expected to have lost 30% of its value and only to be worth about €8,750. In that case the tax to be applied in the newcountry could only be 20% of €8,750 i.e. €1750. ", user: u12)

q4.answers.create(content: "The payment of maintenance by one spouse to the other is an interim measure, i.e. maintenance is paid only until the divorce is granted.

q4.answers.create(content: "The aim of this compensatory payment is to compensate for the disparity that the breakdown of the marriage may create in the respective living conditions of the spouses. Its amount is set by the judge according to the incomes and needs of each spouse. It is by nature a lump sum that is paid, in principle, in the form of capital: either through the payment of a sum of money for which terms of payment may be agreed; or through the allocation of owned assets or a right of use, habitation or usufruct, either on a temporary basis or for life.", user: u15)
q4.answers.create(content: "Exceptionally, the compensatory payment may be set as a life annuity, which may, in the event of changes in the resources or needs of the spouses, be revised downwards.
